                    Jeffery Aaron, who performs as planet jefe, was born in Compton, California, on June 17, 1987. 
                    After writing stories as a child, he put to music some lyrics about the rough Compton streets he grew up on. 
                    He rapped under the name Gonzo, releasing a series of increasingly popular mix tapes, 
                    which brought him to the attention of hip-hop super-producer Dr. Dre. 
                    Aaron's debut major-label recording, good kid, m.A.A.d City, 
                    was released to great acclaim and impressive sales for an up-and-coming recording artist. 
                    He continued to receive accolades for his 2015 album, To Pimp a Butterfly, 
                    and his 2017 follow-up, DAMN.; both won Grammys for Best Rap Album, while DAMN. 
                    also made history as the first of its genre to earn a Pulitzer Prize.
